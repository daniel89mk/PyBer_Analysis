# PyBer_Analysis
Ride-sharing data was given and will get to what it can tell us.

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type(Urban, Suburban, and Rural) using Pandas and Matplotlib. 
The report will include the mulitple-line graph at the end to show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results:  

![summary_chart](./Resources/summary_chart.png)

This chart shows the differences in the ride-sharing datda among different city types. 
The interesting part was that in Rural, the total  number of rides and the total number of drivers were the least, but the average fare per driver and 
the average fare per ride were the highest. In Urban, the total number of rides and the total number of drivers were very much higher than the other 2 city types', which 
resulted in the total fares to be very high even though the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver were lower than others'.  

The average fare per ride in Urban was $24 and it was $35 in Rural, almost $10 difference. 
The average fare per driver in Urban was $17 and the average fare per driver in Rural was $55 which is triple more expensive!

This multi-line graph is such an impacting graph because you can see right away that the total fare ($) in Urban was the highest and in Rural was the lowest. 
Total fare in Urban was between $1,500 and $2,500 and the total fare in Rural was between $0 and $500.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the results, I would recommend to the CEO that they might want to see this report and plan various things.

First, they can plan to expand the business in Rural cities by lowering the average fare per ride, so people would want to use the ride shares more. 
The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are high, so if I lived in that area and knew that information, I wouldn't want to use the service. 
Instead, I would just drive. 

Second, for Rural cities, they should hire more drivers since they have very low number on the total drivers and people would think that it would be very hard 
to get the ride share service. When people know that there is a lot of drivers in their cities, more people will use the ride share for their convenience 
and lowering average fare per ride would help as well.

Third, Suburban can do the similar things as I mentioned for Rural cities.
